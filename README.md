# Text-Exraction-from-Image
Overview:

This project focuses on extracting text from image files using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

It utilizes image pre-processing techniques to enhance the clarity and quality of images before text extraction.

The extracted text can be used for digitizing documents, enabling search, or further data analysis.

Technologies Used:

Python

Tesseract OCR (open-source text recognition engine)

OpenCV (image processing and enhancement)

Pillow (image handling and manipulation)

Matplotlib (for image visualization)

Jupyter Notebook (for interactive development and demonstration)

How to Run:

Open the file Optical_Character_Recognition_using_Image.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Upload or specify the image file you want to process.

Execute the cells step by step to:

Pre-process the image (e.g., convert to grayscale, apply thresholding)

Run OCR using Tesseract

Display the processed image and extracted text
